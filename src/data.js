Shibirs or Satsang - aim to please God. What shall you achieve? God's pleasure.
- One, trust that the Guru is divine and Nirdosh, he is an abode of God.
- Follow his command with total dedication, and...
- ...three treat all his devotees as you would treat Gopalanand Swami; you would, thus, rise
to Gunatitbhav.
- A saint is not God, but an apparatus of God. A saint has attained a divine state of being an
abode of God. God manifests through him and blesses us.
- Serving such a saint is to serve God. This is the kernel of Akshar Purushottam Upasna,
means to realize the pleasure of God.

- Every thought filled with Mahatmya, and each moment filled with the remembrance of God
is meditation...

Q3: What is the way to ceaseless progress on the spiritual path?
- Humility (dsatva) at all times and in all circumstances ■ with constant communion with God
is essential.

Q4: What should be our priority - Satsang or nurturing the child?
- Yogibapa used to tell that children are the gift of God. We must take their utmost care and
look after inculcating values in them. To nurture our children and pay attention to their
studies is akin to our devotion to God.
- Our affection for the children shall make our home filled with love.
- A home filled with love shall inspire devotion.
- God stands for harmony; Yogibapa has never encouraged disharmony in home.
- Therefore, the parents should exercise reason and restraint in following the Satsang.
Q5: Does the kirtan "Sant te swayam Hari..." mean that the saint is God?
- A Saint is not God. Such adjectives are not appropriate for a saint. Yogibapa used to
discourage the usage of such adjectives for him.
- The kirtan "Sant te Swayam Hari..." means that a Gunatit Saint has realised God; and so,
Such Saints function as divine instrument of God, with every moment of their lives remaining
in total union with God.
- The path that we follow is that of humility and service.
- Any achivement sans God and the saints who have realised God, shall be worthless and
shall disconnect us from the vital roots.
Q6: What is the meaning of Dharma, Swadharma and Bhakti?
- To become Brahmroop and perform the Upasana of Parabrahma is Dharma, and to live
according to the directive of the God-manifest sadhu in order to please God, is Swadharma.
- Karma performed by the Agna of the God-realised sant, which uproots one's base bodiliy
inclinations and carried out solely to please god's Manifest swaroop, is bhakti. For us,
"Bhakti" is the life dedicated to the Living embodiment of God and his saints.
- While offering such "Bhakti", when we sustain a ceaseless communion of mind with God,
"Dharma" is realized, effortlessly.
- "Dharma" manifests through a God-realized saint; therefore, a life whose centre is in
harmony with such a saint is a life that realizes "Dharma" and "Bhakti" - both.
Q7: What is the biggest vice on the spiritual path?
- In fact, more than our vices, it is actually our bad habit of finding fault and vices of others,
that restrain our progress more.
- So, come out of the web of mulling over vices of others.
- He who breaks out of this web and tries to see divinity around shall experience perpetual
bliss.
- Such a pure and positive view shall be beneficial to one and all.
- A pure vision shall purify our thoughts.
Q8: What is the simple technique to make the Sadhna uncomplicated?
- Be eager to serve with all the three - the mind, the speech and the body.
- Do remember God constantly while serving the mankind.
- Such a service rendered at the behest of the Saint earns his pleasure.
- Thus, the Saint's pleasure shall make the Sadhna uncomplicated.
- The Sadhna becomes uncomplicated for those who walk on its path ceaselessly
remembering God and serving His devotees.
Q9: What is the Prime Aim of Life?
- It is nice to celebrate the festivals in the best possible manner to please God. The saints
would be naturally happy.
- ...their true happiness would know no bounds when we devote ourselves totally to God.
- Even if the number of such total devouts is small, Guru's happiness would be immense.
- The prime aim of this life is to become a true saint and imbibe saintliness truly.
Q10: What is the solution when the body fails to comply with the Guru's Aagyaa?

indifferent to the body, which is a gift of God, or in distracting it.

- Let your thought and action be sublime.
- Raise the body to become an instrument of God through Satsang, spiritual introspection
and service with Mahatmya.
Q11: Why work hard and invest intellect, when every thing is going to be as per the
theory of Karma?
- Look ! The players would receive the playing cards at random
- ...but, it is their intellect that will be decisive how they will play their cards.
- Similarly, our body may be given in concurrence with our Karma, but... It is entirely up to us
how to utilize it.
- A body utilized as directed by the Guru for earning God's pleasure, gets transformed into a
temple.
Q12: Are religion and science mutually compatible?
- The harmony between religion and science nurture spirituality; that's India's Spiritual
Science.
- A science devoid of religion can make one's life dull and aethistic - just like a sumptuous
cuisine without salt.

narrow-mindedness.

love, affection, compassion and harmony in a truly happy life.
Q13: Isn't it possible to get rid of one's ego by one's own effort independently?
- Isn't it possible to swim the ocean from the shore of Mumbai through that of Mombasa?
- Attempting the egoless state independently is like swiming the ocean all by oneself.
- While, if you board a ship or an aircraft, you can fly over many oceans comfortably.
- Similarly, your communion with an egoless saint shall make you egoless.
- Such a communion with a God-realized saint shall raise you to the state of Gunatit Bhav.
Q14: Why do we apply puja kumkum / chandan on the forehead only?
- The place where puja kumkum / chandan applied is the place of our third eye.
- While, our two outer eyes visualize the outer world, the third eye envisages the intrinsic.
- It's called Brahmarandhra - that provides insight about how to live a life that is totally
oriented towards God.
- So, it has great spiritual significance. Therefore it is reverent.
Q15: What is Gnan?
- Swaminarayan Bhagwan said, "To know and recognise God." is the true Gnan.
- Nathji Bhakt had recognised Maharaj was God and felt that the God that everyone talks of
in Akshardham, was right here !
- True wisdom is to have complete acceptance and complete nirdoshbhav for God.
Q16: What enhances the God's illumination within us?
- If God seems faultless, Santo seem faultless and if bhakto seem faultless then it means
that God's illumination within us has increased.
- As our deh-bhav starts to dissolve, it means that all our physical cravings, our lust, anger,
greed etc. automatically start to decrease...
- By knowing and ‘recognising’ God, our sadhana is made so easy !
Q17: What is the Essence of Spiritual Sadhna?
- But true spiritual practice is this: to recognise God...
- ...to dedicate every moment of one's life, 24 hours a day and 12 months of the year, in
devotion to God...
- ...to live within God...
- ...to perceive God and his bhakto as nirdosh and divya and...
- ...to maintain spiritual harmony with all devotees.
Q18: What is the Secret to attaining Nirdosh-bhav?
- The Secret to attaining Nirdosh-bhav is Mahatmya.
- If we have absolutely firm faith in God and believe him to be eternally faultless and divine...
- ...then this belief is what we call Mahatmya.
- If we have mahatmya then we can accept that God is the Doer in all things.
- ...and that we are immensely fortunate to have attained Him...
- Mahatmya will lead to one's own self as being absolutely nothing ! This feeling is the
hallmark of becoming free from ego.
Q19: How to deal with the intellect, which may raise doubts leading one to have
manushya-bhav?
- The intellect may raise doubts, questions and with inference and logic will lead one to have
manushya-bhav.
- ...but as soon as the base worldly inclinations that reside within the mind transform and
become divine, the mind and intellect will be filled with mahatmya.
- At that point ahankar will be entirely dissolved...
- ...and will think, is this how great God is !
- Next to God, we are nothing !
- If we come to this level of zeroness then our ego will dissolve.
Q20: What awakens the physical body's cravings and desires?
- The ego is the mechanism which awakens the physical body's cravings and desires...
- ...in the same way that electricity is the force behind the microphone. If there is no electricity
then the microphone is simply a pipe !
- In this way, the ego is what keeps the body's shortcomings, cravings and desires alive.
- If that all-important 'I' becomes zero, or is erased, then the body will be freed from all of its
shortcomings, inclinations and cravings.
Q21: What does it mean to belong to God?
- When we belong to God, we are living with the constant desire to please Him.
- We should only have Him at the centre of our lives; not our own desires and inclinations.
- If you have the desire to please God then, you have to think, act and speak in a way which
pleases Him.
- If any one of these three are compromised then we have to recognise our shortcomings,
our weaknesses and our deh-bhav and pray, O Lord please remove this.
- If you offer such prayers with a positive attitude then the hurdles will naturally decrease.
Q22: What is the significance of lighting a lamp in our tradition?
- In the Hindu tradition, light holds great significance.
- The darkness of man's ignorance makes him fluctuate between joy and pain.
- When the light of wisdom comes, then man becomes content for all line.
- The sentiment behind the lighting of lamps is that if the light of wisdom is lit within us...
...then we will be able to experience the true joy of our humcn existence.
Q23: What is the reason that one does not experience complete overflowing joy?
- That is because one is not able to see the God within haribhakto when interacting with
them.
- And the reason one cannot see this is because they have not yet formed a bond with a
Gunatit Purush.
- No matter how purely celibate a man is, or in spite of many powers he has attained...
- ...until and unless one joins with a Gunatit Sadhu and lives his life according to the Gunatit
Sadhu's ruchi, rahasya and abhipray...
- ...till then one can not experience complete overflowing joy in their lives.
Q24: What is the significance of having God/Gunatit Sadhu but not experiencing
constant bliss?
- Suppose a child has a chintamani in his hands - a wish-fulfilling stone, which grants
whatever you wish for.
- But, the child does not know the power of the chintamani, and so uses it casually just like
any other ordinary stone !
- Similarly, God is so great, is all-powerful and can dissolve our deh-bhav, our ego...
- ...but we do not truly understand His mahima, and so we do not make the best possible use
of what we have.
- We have God, but we do not feel blissful of this attainment at all times, and this is our major
drawback.
- Without the bond of a Gunatit Sadhu, one is not able to overcome this drawback.
Q25: What is the minimum we should do to please God?
- We must note the positive qualities of whosoever comes to satsang...
- "...This haribhakt has come to satsang, is offering devotion, is having darshan of Shri
Thakorji... that's it... God is the one who will take care of the conduct of this haribhakt."
- If we feel we do not get on with a haribhakt, then do not keep their company... ...but one
must absolutely not see fault in them...
- ...rather one must note their positive qualities and offer as much seva (service) as possible.
- We do have the freedom and independence to do at least this much!
Q26: Show us the simplest way to liberation, please!
- To live maximally for God and do God's work with the minimum needs are the
characteristics of a Gunatit Sadhu.
- To recognize such a Sadhu is extremely difficult.
- If such a Sadhu enters your life, then the gateway to liberation opens.
- Satpurush is the Gateway to Liberation.
- By joining with a Satpurush, the soul's gateway to liberation is opened.
Q27: How does one recognize a Satpurush who holds God within himself?
- It is extremely difficult to recognize the Satpurush who holds God within himself.
- It is only through God's grace that one is able to recognize sucha Sadhu, or...
- ...by having performed some good deed, or the awakening of a past life association, which
helps us to recognize a Satpurush...
- ...or if God or the Satpurush themselves grant you the wisdom and insight to recognize a
truly Gunatit Satpurush.
- And if you are able to recognize such a Sadhu, then the gateway to liberation is opened for
you.
